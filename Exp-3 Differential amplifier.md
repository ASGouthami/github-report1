# Experiment-3 : Design and Analysis of MOS differential amplifier circuit
A MOS differential amplifier is a key circuit in analog design, used in operational amplifiers, comparators, and analog signal processing. It provides amplification of the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals (such as noise).

A “single-ended” signal is defined as one that is measured with respect to a fixed potential, usually the
ground. A differential signal is defined as one that is measured between two nodes that
have equal and opposite signal excursions around a fixed potential .

Here is a basic differential pair

The two differential inputs, Vin1 and Vin2, having a certain CM level, Vin,C M , are applied to the gates. The
outputs are also differential and swing around the output CM level, Vout,C M .
Such a circuit indeed offers
some of the advantages of differential signaling: high rejection of supply noise, higher output swings, etc.
