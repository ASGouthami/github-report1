## DC,AC and Transient analysis of CS amplifier
### Introduction
The common source amplifier is the basic configuration of mosfet used in analog circuits. It serves as voltage amplifier where, the input is applied to gate terminal, output is taken from drain terminal, source terminal is grounded and the body terminal is connected to the lowest potential i.e gnd. 
The circuit has NMOS as active device, passive resistor(Rd) as load. The circuit is biased using a DC voltage source(1.8V here), and an AC input signal is applied to gate.
The analysis of CS amplifier involves- DC analysis,AC analysis and Transient analysis(using LTspice software)

objective: The objective of this report is to analyse the DC biasing conditions, gain, output impedence and frequency response.
### Key components used and their roles.
1.Vd(Drain supply voltage): Provides the nessesary DC biasing for the N-mosfet.

2.Rd(drain resistor):Provides the required voltage drop to amplify the signal, and sets the output voltage(DC operating point).

3. AC input(at gate): enables amplification by controling drain current.
