# Experiment 6 : CURRENT MIRROR (Design in LTspice using 180 nm technology lib)
## Introduction :
A current mirror circuit is an essential analog building block used to replicate and regulate current in integrated circuits. It ensures that the output current closely matches the reference current, regardless of load variations. Commonly implemented using MOSFETs or BJTs, current mirrors are widely used in biasing, active loads, and current amplification in analog and mixed-signal circuits.

Here is a circuit of basic current mirror:
